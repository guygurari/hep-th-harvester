Currently get-and-filter-arxiv-chunk.pl downloads and upload-to-s3.pl
uploads. They can get out of sync and it's messy.

There's also no real need to tar-bzip the PDFs. It's slow and we can just 
store individual PDFs in S3.

Have the get-and-filter-arxiv-chunk.pl script upload each PDF it is done with.
